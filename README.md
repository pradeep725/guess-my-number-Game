# guess-my-number-Game
I made this game with the help of HTML, CSS , JavaScript.
When a player select enters a guess number it will be compared with the original(secret) number .
if the guess number is equal to the secret number, player wins the game .
if player guess a different number then it will be compared with the secret number and instructions will be given to the player 
,if the guess number is too low or too high.
